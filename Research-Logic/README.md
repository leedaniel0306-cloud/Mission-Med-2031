# 🧬 Research Logic & Clinical Querying

This directory houses the code used to "interrogate" medical datasets and solve clinical problems.

## 🔬 Current Focus: The "Orthopedic Outcome Predictor"
I am currently learning to use **SQL** to filter patient cohorts and **R** to identify correlations between surgical timing and patient recovery.

## 📂 Key Files
- `Ortho_Patient_Query.sql`: A template query for isolating elderly hip-fracture patients.
- *Coming Soon:* `Recovery_Regression_Model.R`: Analysis of post-operative mobility trends.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **SQL:** PostGreSQL / BigQuery logic
- **R:** tidyverse, ggplot2, dpyr
