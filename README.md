## Projects

### 🔬 Orthopedic Outcome Predictor `[In Progress]`
A clinical data pipeline querying and modeling orthopedic patient outcomes using SQL and R. Focuses on identifying prognostic patterns relevant to surgical decision-making using logistic regression and survival analysis.

### 📊 Public Health Hackathon — Health Equity Analysis `[February 2026]`
Competing in a public health hackathon analyzing population-level datasets (NHANES/BRFSS) to surface health equity insights. Stack: R (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`). Role: data wrangling, visualization, and narrative translation of statistical findings for a clinical audience.

### 🧠 Anatomical Segmentation Gallery `[Pending]`
A curated set of 3D segmentations of orthopedic anatomy built in 3D Slicer. Demonstrates proficiency in landmark identification and surgical planning workflows.

### ⚙️ Slicer-Python Automation Tool `[Pending]`
A scripted automation layer for repetitive 3D Slicer tasks using the Slicer Python API, reducing manual overhead in segmentation and image processing pipelines.
